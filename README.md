# patientAISimulator
A program designed to help Doctors take history by simulating a patient who has a particular disease.


The file pipelineCAP uses the BERT natural language processing model to answer questions in the context of provided information. For convenience, I have used the Transformers Pipelines function to streamline tokenization and intepretation (at the expense of increased processing time). In future I hope to make this program 
1. More accessible via a webapp
2. Less processor-intensive.
